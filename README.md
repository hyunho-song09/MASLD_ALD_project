# Multi-Omics Analysis Pipeline for Liver Disease Research

## Overview

This repository contains an optimized R pipeline for multi-omics analysis of liver disease progression, specifically focusing on Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) and Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). The pipeline integrates clinical parameters, metabolomics, and microbiome data to identify biomarkers and understand disease mechanisms.

## Repository Structure

### PART1_step1-3.R
 * Correlation analysis, explained variance, and PCoA

### PART1_step4-6.R
 * Disease progression analysis and ROC-based classification

### PART1_step7-9.R
 * Etiology comparison, feature selection, and visualization

### PART2_step1-3.R
 * Functional analysis (MGS-phenotype association)

### PART2_step4-6.R
 * Driver species identification and strain analysis

### PART2_step7-8.R
 * Mediation analysis and pathway visualization

### README.md
 * This file

### data/
 * Data directory (create and populate)

### output/
 * Results directory (automatically created)
