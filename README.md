# Multi-Omics Analysis Pipeline for Liver Disease Research

## Overview

This repository contains an optimized R pipeline for multi-omics analysis of liver disease progression, specifically focusing on Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) and Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). The pipeline integrates clinical parameters, metabolomics, and microbiome data to identify biomarkers and understand disease mechanisms.
